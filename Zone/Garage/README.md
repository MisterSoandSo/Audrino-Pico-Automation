# Zone Automation / Garage

I wanted to seperated my automations in different zones. For the case of Garage Zone, I wanted to handle all the Home Assistant automation on in this part of the repository. The purpose of this project is to be able to tell whether my garage door is open/closed, the temperature inside my garage, and update my aged sprinkler system to a smart sprinkler.

In each segment, I will list the parts used and instructions on how to assemble each segment. At the end of this portion of the project, I would combine each segment to be controlled on a single Raspberry Pi Pico W.
